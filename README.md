# Fresh Free Tuts

Idea here is that decent relevant tutorials often get lost in the noise and when you find a good one, it's usually old and outdated.

This project aims to aggregate tutorials that meet certain quality criteria and list them in a twitter style feed.

More User based features will be added eventually.
